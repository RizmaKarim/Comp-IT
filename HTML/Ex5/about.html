        Tess Gerritsen is the child of a Chinese immigrant and a Chinese-American seafood chef.
        While growing up in San Diego, California, Gerritsen often dreamt of writing her own Nancy Drew novels.
        Her first name is Terry, she decided to feminize it when she was a writer of romance novels.
        Although she longed to be a writer, her family had reservations about the sustainability of a writing career, prompting Gerritsen to choose a career in medicine.
