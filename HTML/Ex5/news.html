    <p>
        The Winnipeg Sun is a daily tabloid newspaper in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is owned by Postmedia following its acquisition of Sun Media and shares many characteristics typical of Sun tabloids, including an emphasis on local news stories, extensive sports coverage, a Canadian conservatism editorial stance, and a daily Sunshine Girl.
    </p>
    <p>
        The newspaper, like most of those in the Canadian Sun chain, are known for short, snappy news stories aimed primarily at working class readers.
        The Sun's layout is based somewhat upon that of British tabloids.
    </p>
    <p>
        The newspaper is distributed throughout the Winnipeg metro region through retail sales, vending machines and home delivery.
