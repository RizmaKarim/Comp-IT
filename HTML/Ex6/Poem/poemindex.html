    <h3>Annabel Lee</h3>

    <p>It was many and many a year ago,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn a kingdom by the sea,</p>
    <p>That a maiden there lived whom you may know</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspBy the name of Annabel Lee;</p>
    <p>And this maiden she lived with no other thought</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspThan to love and be loved by me.</p><br>
    <p>I was a child and she was a child,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn this kingdom by the sea,</p>
    <p>But we loved with a love that was more than love</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspI and my Annabel Lee</p>
    <p>With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspCoveted her and me.</p><br>
     
    <p>And this was the reason that, long ago,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn this kingdom by the sea,</p>
    <p>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspMy beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
    <p>So that her highborn kinsmen came</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspAnd bore her away from me,</p>
    <p>To shut her up in a sepulchre</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn this kingdom by the sea.</p><br>
     
    <p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspWent envying her and me</p>
    <p>Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn this kingdom by the sea)</p>
    <p>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspChilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p><br>
     
    <p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspOf those who were older than we</p>
    <p>Of many far wiser than we</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspAnd neither the angels in Heaven above</p>
    <p>Nor the demons down under the sea</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspCan ever dissever my soul from the soul</p>
    <p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p><br>
     
    <p>&nbsp &nbspFor the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams</p>
    <p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes</p>
    <p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side</p>
    <p>Of my darling my darling my life and my bride,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn her sepulchre there by the sea</p>
    <p>In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>

    <a name="Eldorado"></a>
    <h3>Eldorado</h3>
    <p>Gaily bedight,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspA gallant knight,</p>
    <p>In sunshine and in shadow,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspHad journeyed long,</p>   
    <p>Singing a song,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn search of Eldorado.</p>

    <p>But he grew old</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspThis knight so bold</p>  
    <p>nd o'er his heart a shadow</p>  
    <p>&nbsp &nbspFell as he found</p>
    <p>No spot of ground</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspThat looked like Eldorado.</p>

    <p>And, as his strength</p>   
    <p>&nbsp &nbspFailed him at length,</p>
    <p>He met a pilgrim shadow</p>  
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp'Shadow,' said he,</p> 
    <p>'Where can it be</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspThis land of Eldorado?'</p>

    <p>'Over the Mountains</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbspOf the Moon,</p>
    <p>Down the Valley of the Shadow,</p> 
    <p>&nbsp &nbspRide, boldly ride,'</p>
    <p>The shade replied,</p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp'If you seek for Eldorado!'</p>

    <a name="Raven"></a>
    <h3>The Raven</h3>
    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</p>
        <p>$nbsp Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</p>
        <p>&nbsp As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only this and nothing more."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</p>
        <p>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore</p>
        <p>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nameless here for evermore.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</p>
        <p>Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</p>
        <p>&nbsp So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door</p>
        <p>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This it is and nothing more."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</p>
        <p>"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</p>
        <p>&nbsp But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</p>
        <p>&nbsp And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</p>
        <p>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDarkness there and nothing more.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</p>
        <p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</p>
        <p>&nbsp But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</p>
        <p>&nbsp And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”</p>
        <p>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Merely this and nothing more.</p>

        <p>&nbsp Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</p>
        <p>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;</p>
        <p>&nbsp Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore</p>
        <p>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 'Tis the wind and nothing more!"</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</p>
        <p>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;</p>
        <p>&nbsp Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</p>
        <p>&nbsp But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door</p>
        <p>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
        
        <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</p>
        <p>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</p>
        <p>"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven</p>
        <p>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore</p>
        <p>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</p>
        <p>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;</p>
        <p>&nbsp For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</p>
        <p>&nbsp Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door</p>
        <p>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With such name as "Nevermore."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</p>
        <p>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp Nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered</p>
        <p>&nbsp Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before</p>
        <p>On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the bird said "Nevermore."</p>
        
        <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</p>
        <p>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store</p>
        <p>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</p>
        <p>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore</p>
        <p>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</p>
        <p>Of 'Never nevermore'."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,</p>
        <p>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</p>
        <p>&nbsp Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</p>
        <p>&nbsp Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore</p>
        <p>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</p>
                
        <p>&nbsp This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</p>
        <p>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;</p>
        <p>&nbsp This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</p>
        <p>&nbsp On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp light gloated o'er,</p>
        <p>But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp light gloating o'er,</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</p>
        <p>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;</p>
        <p>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!</p>
        <p>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</p>
        <p>&nbsp Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted</p>
        <p>&nbsp On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly, I implore</p>
        <p>Is there is there balm in Gilead? tell me tell me, I implore!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!</p>
        <p>By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore</p>
        <p>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspQuoth the Raven "Nevermore."
        
        <p>&nbsp "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting</p>
        <p>"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!</p>
        <p>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</p>
        <p>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp And the lamp light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</p>
        <p>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shall be lifted nevermore!</p>
