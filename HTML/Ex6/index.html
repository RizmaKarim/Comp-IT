    <h4>Introduction of Edgar Allan Poe</h4>
    <p><!--p1-->
        Edgar Allan Poe born Edgar Poe January 19, 1809 to October 7, 1849 was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic.
        Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.
        He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story.
        He is also generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction.
        Poe was the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.
    </p>
    <p><!--p2-->
        Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth "Eliza" Poe.
        His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year.
        Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia.
        They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood.
        Tension developed later as Poe and John Allan repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's education.
    </p>
    <p><!--p3-->
        Poe attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money.
        He quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the United States Army in 1827 under an assumed name.
        It was at this time that his publishing career began with the anonymous collection Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian".
        Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829.
        Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with Allan.
    </p>
    <p><!--p4-->
        Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism.
        His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.
        He married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, in 1836, but Virginia died of tuberculosis in 1847.
        In January 1845, Poe published his poem "The Raven" to instant success.
        He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), but before it could be produced, he died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40.
        The cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, suicide, and other causes

    <h3> Life and career</h3> 
    <p><!--p5-->
        <h4>Early Life</h4>
        <img src="Edgar_Allan_Poe_Birthplace_Boston.jpg">This plaque in Boston marks the approximate location where Edgar Poe was born.<br><br>
        Edgar Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 19, 1809, the second child of English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe and actor David Poe Jr.
        He had an elder brother named William Henry Leonard Poe and a younger sister named Rosalie Poe.
        Their grandfather, David Poe Sr., emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland around 1750.
        Edgar may have been named after a character in William Shakespeare's King Lear, which the couple were performing in 1809.
        His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died a year later from consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis).
        Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in Richmond, Virginia who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones, tobacco, and slaves.
        The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name "Edgar Allan Poe", though they never formally adopted him
    </p>
    <p><!--p6-->
        The Allan family had Poe baptized into the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.
        The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland (where Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London in 1816.
        There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb 4 miles (6 km) north of London.
    </p>
    <p><!--p7-->
        Poe moved with the Allans back to Richmond in 1820.
        In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette.
        In March 1825, Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond,leaving Allan several acres of real estate.
        The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 (equivalent to $17,000,000 in 2019).
        By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick home named Moldavia.
    </p>
    <p><!--p8-->
        Poe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages.
        The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. 
        It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored.
        Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty.
        The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts.
        He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory.
        Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased.
        Poe gave up on the university after a year but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married another man, Alexander Shelton.
        He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer and he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet during this period
    </p>
    <p><!--p9-->
        <h4>Military Career</h4>
        <img src="Independence2.jpg">Poe was first stationed at Boston's Fort Independence while in the Army.<br><br>
        Poe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the United States Army as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name "Edgar A. Perry".
        He claimed that he was 22 years old even though he was 18.
        He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month.
        That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline "by a Bostonian".
        Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.
    </p>
    <p><!--p10-->
        Poe's regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827.
        Poe was promoted to "artificer", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled.
        He served for two years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve); he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early.
        Poe revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who would only allow Poe to be discharged if he reconciled with Allan.
        Poe wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe's pleas; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness.
        Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial.
        Perhaps softened by his wife's death, Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.
    </p>
    <p><!--p11-->   
        Poe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.
        Before entering West Point, he moved back to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.
        Meanwhile, Poe published his second book Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems in Baltimore in 1829.
    </p>
    <p><!--p12-->
        Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.
        In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.
        The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.
        Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church.
        He tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.
    </p>
    <p><!--p13-->
        Poe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled Poems.
        The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75 cents to the cause, raising a total of $170.
        They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers.
        It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as "Second Edition," and including a page saying, "To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated".
        The book once again reprinted the long poems "Tamerlane" and "Al Aaraaf" but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of "To Helen", "Israfel", and "The City in the Sea".
        Poe returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831.
        His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, in part due to problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.
    </p>
    <p><!--p14-->
        <h4>Publishing Career</h4>
        <img src="VirginiaPoe.jpg">Poe (age 26) obtained a license in 1835 to marry his cousin Virginia Clemm (age 13). They were married for 11 years until her death, which may have inspired some of his writing.<br><br>
        After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer, but he chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.
        He was one of the first Americans to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law.
        American publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans.
        The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837.
        There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues.
        Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.
    </p>
    <p><!--p15-->
        After his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose. He placed a few stories with a Philadelphia publication and began work on his only drama Politian.
        The Baltimore Saturday Visiter awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his short story "MS. Found in a Bottle".
        The story brought him to the attention of John P. Kennedy, a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond.
    </p>
    <p><!--p16-->
        Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835 but White discharged him within a few weeks for being drunk on the job.
        Poe returned to Baltimore where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.
        He was 26 and she was 13.
    </p>
    <p><!--p17-->
        Poe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and he went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother.
        He remained at the Messenger until January 1837.
        During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.
        He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper.
        On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.
    </p>
    <p><!--p18-->
        Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was published and widely reviewed in 1838.
        In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine.
        He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the Messenger.
        Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque was published in two volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.
        Poe left Burton's after about a year and found a position as assistant at Graham's Magazine.
    </p>
    <p><!--p19-->
        In June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called The Stylus, although he originally intended to call it The Penn, as it would have been based in Philadelphia.
        He bought advertising space for his prospectus in the June 6, 1840 issue of Philadelphia's Saturday Evening Post: "Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.
        The journal was never produced before Poe's death.
    </p>
    <p><!--p20-->
        Around this time, Poe attempted to secure a position within the administration of President John Tyler, claiming that he was a member of the Whig Party.
        He hoped to be appointed to the United States Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert,an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas.
        Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk.
        Poe was promised an appointment, but all positions were filled by others.
    </p>
    <p><!--p21-->
        One evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, now known as tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano, which Poe described as breaking a blood vessel in her throat.
        She only partially recovered, and Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of her illness.
        He left Graham's and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post.
        He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal, and later its owner.
        There Poe alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded.
        On January 29, 1845, his poem "The Raven" appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation.
        It made Poe a household name almost instantly,though he was paid only $9 for its publication.
        It was concurrently published in The American Review: A Whig Journal under the pseudonym "Quarles".
    </p>
    <p><!--p22-->
        The Broadway Journal failed in 1846 and Poe moved to a cottage in Fordham, New York, in what is now the Bronx.
        That home is now known as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, relocated to a park near the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road.
        Nearby, Poe befriended the Jesuits at St. John's College, now Fordham University.
        Virginia died at the cottage on January 30, 1847.
        Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe's frequent theme of the "death of a beautiful woman" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.[68]
    </p>
    <p><!--p23-->
        Poe was increasingly unstable after his wife's death.
        He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman who lived in Providence, Rhode Island.
        Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior.
        There is also strong evidence that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship.
        Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.
    </p>
    <p><!--p24-->
        <h3>Death</h3>
        <img src="EdgarAllanPoeGrave.jpg">Edgar Allan Poe is buried at Westminster Hall in Baltimore, Maryland. The circumstances and cause of his death remain uncertain.<br><br>
        On October 3, 1849, Poe was found delirious on the streets of Baltimore, "in great distress, and… in need of immediate assistance", according to Joseph W. Walker, who found him.
        He was taken to the Washington Medical College, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning.
    </p>
    <p><!--25-->
        Poe was not coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were not his own.
        He is said to have repeatedly called out the name "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring.
        Some sources say that Poe's final words were, "Lord help my poor soul".
        All medical records have been lost, including Poe's death certificate

        <h2> Edgar Allan Poe's Poems</h2>
        <h3>Annabell Lee</h3>
        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        The poem's narrator describes his love for Annabel Lee, which began many years ago in a "kingdom by the sea".
        Though they were young, their love for one another burned with such an intensity that angels became envious.
        It is for that reason that the narrator believes the seraphim caused her death.
        Even so, their love is strong enough that it extends beyond the grave and the narrator believes their two souls are still entwined.
        Every night, the narrator dreams of Annabel Lee and sees the brightness of her eyes in the stars.
        Every night the narrator lies down by her side in her tomb by the sea.

        <h3>Eldorado</h3>
        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        The poem describes the journey of a "gallant knight" in search of the legendary El Dorado.
        The knight spends much of his life on this quest.
        In his old age, he finally meets a "pilgrim shadow" who points the way through "the Valley of Shadow".
        It was first published in the April 21, 1849, issue of the Boston-based The Flag of Our Union.

        <h3>The Raven</h3>
        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        <p>
            Raven" follows an unnamed narrator on a dreary night in December who sits reading "forgotten lore" by a dying fire as a way to forget the death of his beloved Lenore.
            A "tapping at [his] chamber door" reveals nothing, but excites his soul to "burning".
            The tapping is repeated, slightly louder, and he realizes it is coming from his window.
            When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber.
            Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a bust of Pallas above the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amused by the raven's comically serious disposition, the man asks that the bird tell him its name.
            The raven's only answer is "Nevermore".
            The narrator is surprised that the raven can talk, though at this point it has said nothing further.
            The narrator remarks to himself that his "friend" the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as "other friends have flown before" along with his previous hopes.
            As if answering, the raven responds again with "Nevermore".
            The narrator reasons that the bird learned the word "Nevermore" from some "unhappy master" and that it is the only word it knows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even so, the narrator pulls his chair directly in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. 
            He thinks for a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. 
            He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore.
            The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories.
            The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a "thing of evil" and a "prophet".
            Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven.
            When the raven responds with its typical "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the "Plutonian shore" but it does not move.
            Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven "still is sitting" on the bust of Pallas.
            The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted "Nevermore".
